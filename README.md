## 🔍 How It Works

### 1. Intelligent URL Discovery

The system starts with a base URL and intelligently discovers related pages:

```python
# Priority patterns for important pages
priority_patterns = [
    '/about', '/services', '/products', '/blog', '/news', '/faq',
    '/contact', '/help', '/docs', '/documentation', '/api'
]
```

The crawler prioritizes these important sections while respecting domain boundaries and filtering out unwanted file types.

### 2. Parallel Web Scraping

Multiple Chrome browser instances work simultaneously:

```python
# Parallel processing with progress tracking
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers) as executor:
    future_to_url = {
        executor.submit(self.scrape_single_page, url, extract_images): url
        for url in urls
    }
```

Each worker:
- Opens a headless Chrome browser
- Loads the target page
- Extracts HTML content
- Processes images for OCR text
- Returns structured data

### 3. OCR Text Extraction

For each page, the system identifies images and extracts text:

```python
# EasyOCR processing
results = self.ocr_reader.readtext(response.content)
text = " ".join([result[1] for result in results])

# Tesseract fallback
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(pil_img)
```

This dual approach ensures compatibility across different hardware configurations.

### 4. Vector Storage and Retrieval

Content is chunked and stored with metadata:

```python
# Content chunking for better search
chunk_size = 800
words = content.split()
for j, chunk_start in enumerate(range(0, len(words), chunk_size)):
    chunk = ' '.join(words[chunk_start:chunk_start + chunk_size])
```

ChromaDB handles vector embeddings and semantic search automatically.

### 5. AI Response Generation

Retrieved content provides context for AI responses:

```python
# Prepare context from search results
context = ""
for i, item in enumerate(relevant_content):
    metadata = item.get('metadata', {})
    content = item.get('content', '')
    context += f"\n\nSource {i+1} (from {metadata.get('title', 'Unknown')}):\n{content}"
```

Google Gemini uses this context to generate accurate, source-attributed responses.
